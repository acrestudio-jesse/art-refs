Hello.
This is a student resource for my art class.
----
This is a simple read only site that provides condensed tutorials of art fundamentals. My goal is to make an accessible site for students to keep up on new concepts in class. 

GOALS:
Populate information on subjects
Create a folder containing examples for each instruction
Create a contact for in case students want to request more information.

----
If you have page that you would like to host, or you find a typo within
the website content, feel from to contact me for a correction.

Cheers.
